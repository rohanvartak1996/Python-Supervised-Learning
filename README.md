Python Implementation of basic supervised learning algorithms. The algorithms were used on breast cancer dataset for predicting cancer.
Following Algorithms are implemented from scratch:
  1) K-Nearest Neighours
  2) Decision Tree Classifier
  3) Perceptron Algorithm
  4) Multilayer Perceptron (BackPropogation)
This project was done as a part of the coursework for Artificial Intelligence course.
